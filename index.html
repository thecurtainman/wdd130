                    <p>Hello! My name is Jarred Merriam and I am from Winchester, Virginia.  Going back to school and completing my degree has always been a goal and I look forward to continuing that journey through this course as I work towards my BS in Software Development.  I am a Husband, Father of 6, US Army Veteran, IT Professional of 18 years, and TTRPG player, and Convert to the Church originally from New England, but eventually transplanted to Virginia.  Best wishes to all as we continue to progress throughout our studies, I look forward to working and learning with you.</p>
